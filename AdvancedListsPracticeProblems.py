print("Problem # 1 - Every Three Numbers")

# Create a function called every_three_nums that has one parameter named start.
#
# The function should return a list of every third number between start and
# 100 (inclusive). For example, every_three_nums(91) should return the list [91, 94, 97, 100].
# If start is greater than 100, the function should return an empty list.

# Write your function here

# Create a function named remove_middle which has three parameters named lst, start, and end.
#
# The function should return a list where all elements in lst with an index between start and end (inclusive) have been removed.
#
# For example, the following code should return [4, 23, 42] because elements at indices 1, 2, and 3 have been removed:
# remove_middle([4, 8 , 15, 16, 23, 42], 1, 3)

# Create a function named more_frequent_item that has three parameters named lst, item1, and item2.

# If the two items appear the same number of times, return item1.

print("Problem # 4 - Double Index")

# Create a function named double_index that has two parameters: a list named lst and a single number named index.
#
# The function should return a new list where all elements are the same as in lst except for the element at index.
# The element at index should be double the value of the element at index of the original lst.
#
# If index is not a valid index, the function should return the original list.
# For example, the following code should return [1,2,6,4] because the element at index 2 has been doubled:
# double_index([1, 2, 3, 4], 2)
#
# After writing your function, un-comment the call to the function that weâ€™ve provided for you to test your results.

print("Problem # 5 - Middle Item")

# Create a function called middle_element that has one parameter named lst.
#
# If there are an odd number of elements in lst, the function should return the middle element.
# If there are an even number of elements, the function should return the average of the middle two elements.

# Write your function here
